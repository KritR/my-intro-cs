# Introduction

Hello. Welcome to my intro to cs course. Let's take care of a couple formalities before we get to the actual content.

## Who am I ?

So my name's Krithik.

I'm a CS Student at Purdue at the time of writing this. I've so far interned at two software companies. GE Transportation and Microsoft. In addition, I've worked on a number of different personal projects and did robotics in high school.

At this point I feel like I've covered a wide range of computer science related topics and have gone through enough coursework to understand what computer science is about from a high school / undergraduate academic perspective.

I think what's also relevant mentioning is that I am a self taught programmer. I learned about Java and Linux after wanting to run a Minecraft server with friends. I would argue this self taught experience changes my perspective on how CS is traditionally taught.

## Why am I writing this ?

I am writing this course after being frustrated by my experience in college with how CS is taught. I've personally seen many of my peers struggle to understand CS fundamentals because the introductory courses were insufficient.

I feel like one of the most important things you can do for yourself in any field, is to build up appropriate mental models for understanding the content you're learning. I would hope the point of any intro class, is to build this framework for understanding. Unfortunately it is all too common in CS as it's taught, to throw new learners into the deep end without any grounding. This is something I hope to address in this course.

After a long discussion with my friend at late hours of night, I finally decided how I would approach teaching CS and decided to start writing this.
